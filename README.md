# BATTLESHIP PYTHON GAME

This is a Battleship Game wrote in Python and deployed using HEROKU

## Features 

- __Gameplay__

  There is no navigation on this site as the website is just a simple game for the user to enjoy. The player chooses from one of the 5 options.
  after the selection, a random number is generated to simulate the cpu turn and depending on the selections. a outcome will be determined via switch statement and nested   if statements
  
  also as the player hovers over there selection, their selection will increase in size to give the player some feedback as to their selection.

- __Game Conclusion__

  When either the player or cpu have reached a score of 10, the player will be alerted of the winner and the webpage will then reload.

## Features Left to Implement

- __better design__
  I would have like to have worked on the CSS more as it is something that I struggle with and would have liked to add alot more flare and finese. (will come back to     improve it)
  would like to add sound effects and other such feedback for the user, maybe some animations to show the result of each hand.

## Testing 

- throughout the development, monitored all values by logging results in the chrome console to ensure that I was getting the correct results/scores for each hand
- I tested the webpage in multiple differnet website e.g chrome, firefox and edge. also tested the site on my own phone and all functioned correctly

## Bugs

Didnt come across any bugs in the javascript portion of this project, but the CSS, I struggled with the alighment of the text on the web page when doing my media querys (need to practice CSS more)
